# MiniPunjabiLLM
### Description: 
In this repository I am trying to train my own LLM (actually MLM i.e. mini langugae model) from scratch, I have trained a langugae model for next character prediction for Punjabi Langugae.
### Goal:
To revise the decoder only transformer architecture by implemeting it in Pytorch and to have a better understanding of langugae models in general.
