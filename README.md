### Description: 
In this repository I am trying to train my own LLM (actually MLM i.e. mini langugae model) from scratch, using my language (Punjabi)
### Goal:
To revise the decoder only transformer architecture by implemeting it in Pytorch and to have a better understanding of langugae models in general.
